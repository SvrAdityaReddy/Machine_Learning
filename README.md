## Assignment 1

In this Assignment we had used *housing dataset*, *iris dataset*, *engage dataset (unnamed dataset)*.<\br>

In case of *housing dataset*, we had implemented *Linear Regression (Closed Form, Gradient Descent and Newton's method)*, *Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)* from scratch and had used *scikit-learn* library for *Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)* and *Accuracy Score measurement*. The *jupyter-notebook* file, python code and other files related to *housing dataset* can be found under the directory [Assignment_1/housing_data_set](https://github.com/SvrAdityaReddy/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Assignment_1/housing_data_set) </br>

In case of *iris dataset*, we had implemented *Nearest Neighbours*, *Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian distribution)*, *Logistic Regression (Gradient Descent and Newton's method)* from scratch and had used *scikit-learn* library for *Logistic Regression (for comparison between Implemented and inbuilt)* and *Accuracy Score measurement*. The *jupyter-notebook* file, python code and other files related to *iris dataset* can be found under the directory [Assignment_1/iris_data_set](https://github.com/SvrAdityaReddy/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Assignment_1/iris_data_set) </br>

In case of *engage dataset (unnamed dataset)*, we had used the same models used in case of *iris dataset* and had used *Precision*, *F-measure*, *Recall*, *AUC* apart from *Accuracy Score measurement* using *scikit-learn* library. The *jupyter-notebook* file, python code and other files related to *iris dataset* can be found under the directory [Assignment_1/engage_data_set](https://github.com/SvrAdityaReddy/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Assignment_1/engage_data_set) </br>
